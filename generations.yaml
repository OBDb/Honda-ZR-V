    description: "The Honda ZR-V (known as the HR-V in North America but distinct from the global HR-V/Vezel) is a compact crossover SUV positioned between the smaller HR-V/Vezel and larger CR-V in Honda's global lineup. Built on the eleventh-generation Civic platform rather than the Fit/Jazz basis used for the global HR-V, it features sportier styling with a lower roofline and longer hood compared to typical compact SUVs. The exterior design incorporates a prominent hexagonal grille, sleek LED headlights, clean body sides with a single character line, and a coupe-like sloping rear with a tailgate spoiler. Powertrain options vary by market, with European models featuring Honda's e:HEV hybrid system combining a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle engine with electric motors for a combined 184 HP, while North American versions (as the HR-V) utilize a 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 158 HP. Japanese and Chinese markets also receive a 1.5L turbocharged option. The interior shares much of its design and technology with the latest Civic, featuring a clean, horizontal dashboard layout with a honeycomb mesh accent concealing the air vents, and either a 7-inch or 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system depending on trim level. Unlike the smaller global HR-V, it lacks the 'Magic Seat' system but offers more passenger space, particularly in the rear seats. Safety features include the comprehensive Honda Sensing suite with improved capabilities like Traffic Jam Assist on higher trims. The ZR-V/North American HR-V represents Honda's response to market fragmentation in the crossover segment, offering a sportier, more car-like alternative to the practical, space-efficient approach of the global HR-V."
